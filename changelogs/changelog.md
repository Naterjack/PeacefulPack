# CHANGELOG

The aim of this pack is twofold:
1. To make more of the game's features and blocks avaiable in the peaceful difficulty mode.
2. To make more of the game's features and blocks avaiable even if the player choses a "vegetarian" (full passive) play style

## CRAFTING
- Rotten flesh can be smelted to leather
- Dried kelp can be crafted into leather (four in a square => four leather) (vegan version)
- Charcoal and magma cream can be crafted into gunpowder
- 
### "Uncrafting"
- Magma blocks can be uncrafted into magma cream
- Quartz blocks can be uncrafted into quartz

## FISHING
Most of the changes of this pack utilise fishing as the main mechanic for mob drops

- AFK Fishing drops treasure loot again, but only when using a fishing rod with "Lure 3" (or higher) (i.e. the open water requirement is ignored when using a Lure 3 rod)
- Fishing at (or above) the ocean monument now can be used to obtain prismarine shards/crystals , black dye and (very rarely) sponge.

### New rods
- Evil Rod (Luck of the Sea 666)
- Obtained from barterting in the overworld
- - allows for fishing up loot usualy dropped by wither skeletons (and the wither)

fishing with a wither skell skull in offhand gives a n% chance to fish a nether star
